      We are a passionate community of coders, designers and explorers
      who like to learn by doing. The core philosophy of this club is
      building fun, real-world projects to learn coding. Coding is a
      superpower and it shows that you do not need much to change the
      world — just a computer or even a phone and a creative mind.
      <br />
      <br /> Coding has become an essential skill for thousands of
      professions and technological literacy is absolutely necessary in
      today’s world where technology is a key aspect of our everyday
      lives. We aim to bring this necessary technological literacy to
      everyone so that no one is left behind in this revolution.
