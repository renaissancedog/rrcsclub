        <p class="m-12 w-fit text-3xl text-white font-light">
          We are a passionate community of coders, designers and explorers
          who like to learn by doing. The core philosophy of this club is
          building fun, real-world projects to learn coding. Coding is a
          superpower and it shows that you do not need much to change the
          world â€” just a computer or even a phone and a creative mind. <br><br>
          Coding has become an essential skill for thousands of
          professions and technological literacy is absolutely necessary in
          today's world where technology is a key aspect of our everyday
          lives. We aim to bring this necessary technological literacy to
          everyone so that no one is left behind in this revolution.
