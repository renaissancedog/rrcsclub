This is a redesigned website for the Ronald Reagan Computer Science Club (Est. 2021). Take a look at it [here](https://renaissancedog.github.io/rrcsclub/)!

## The Club
We are a club located at Ronald Reagan High School, San Antonio and are dedicated to provide members resources to code and make amazing projects that will benefit the community. In essence, we want to introduce Computer Science to beginners and expand the horizons of those with some previous knowledge so that they can build their dream. We strongly believe that Computer Science is a creative endeavor that benefits the entire world in many ways, and this was only amplified during the Coronaivrus pandemic.

## Motivation
This website was built in order to host all the necessary information for members at the Reagan Computer Science Club and provide a clear way to apply and contact the club. The idea behind the design and color schemes also follows a principle to keep it easy to use and simple to understand.

As we continue to build out this website, we are increasingly motivated by our members and their needs as well as their feedback. The website is continusously trying to improve as we attempt to create a complete resource for members to use.

## Next Steps
Currently, we want to come up with a better UI than our card-based model for the Team, Wall of Fame and Events pages.
We also need to create a workshops page.

## Contributing
Constributions are always welcome! Help us achieve our goals outlined in next steps by opening issues, pushing code, or adding to discussion in issues and PRs.
